### What are some of your favorite PHP design patterns?
#### Answer
The Singleton: Used when you only want to allow access to one instance of a particular class.

The Factory: The factory pattern makes it easier to create multiple classes without repeating code. To change, rename, or replace the class, simply modify the factory.

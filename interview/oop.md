# OOP
### Explain the difference between classes and interfaces.
#### Answer
In laymanâ€™s terms, an interface is a class without all the business logic. In an interface, all methods must be public and multiple inheritance is supported. However, all methods must be defined within the class that implements them. Abstract classes, on the other hand, can be declared with modifiers like public or internal, and can define properties or variables. Abstract classes do not support multiple inheritance and can only be extended by one abstract class.

## #1 IP address
How do you proceed if you need to get a user’s IP address?”
### Answer
This question shows the level of creativity of the developer, as there are many possibilities to find an IP address.  For example, we can use the script : $_SERVER[“REMOTE_ADDR”];
This is the fastest and most obvious answer, but a multitude of other solutions are possible.
## #2 Traits
What are Traits made for?
### Answer
Traits are an advanced feature of PHP, they allow to create reusable code in a language like PHP. A Trait cannot be generated by itself, the candidate must be familiar with the advanced functionalities of a programming language in which he or she will be required to work. Knowledge of these features is an important indication of the candidate’s familiarity with this language.
## #3 Errors
Describe the three error types that exist in PHP.
### Answer
Knowledge of error types is fundamental for any developer, especially those who use PHP. This knowledge allows the developer to understand where the errors come from in order to be able to fix them as well as possible.

Here the candidate must first list the error types and then explain them. He must say that there are three errors types: Notices, Warning and Fatal. Then, the candidate must explain that Notices are errors that occur when the error is simple and non-critical, while Warning is a more serious error. In both cases, these errors will not cause the script to stop running. The last error, called Fatal, is much more problematic since it causes the script to stop running.

## #5 Good programmer
What do you think are the essential attributes that a PHP developer should have?

### Answer
The answer to this interview question determines whether the candidate has any knowledge of object-oriented programming. All objects in the PHP language have construct and destruct methods built-in. The Constructor method is used each time a new class instance is created, it is then called to initialize the properties of this class. The destruct method does not accept any parameters.

## #6 Script execution

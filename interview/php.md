## Code
### Determine the value of $pear after executing the code below. What will strlen($pear) return? Explain your answer.
```php
$pear = ‘PEAR ’;
$pear[12] = ‘PHP Extension and Application Repository’;
```
::: warning Answer
This question reveals a few interesting things about the way PHP interprets code. The value of $pear in the code above will be the string “PEAR P” or the string “PEAR ” followed by seven spaces, followed by “P,” which is the first character in the string “PHP Extension and Application Repository.” The value returned by strlen($pear) will thus be 13. Since an element of a string can only consist of one character, and the count of elements within a string starts with 0, $pear[12] sets the 13th character of the string to the letter “P.” Interestingly enough, we chose to set the 13th value of a string that only has five characters. While other language interpreters might have thrown an out-of-bounds index error, PHP is more forgiving and fills in the blanks with empty spaces.

### Determine the output of the code below. Explain your answer.
```php
var_dump(42 == 042);
var_dump(‘042’ == 42);
var_dump(‘042’ === 42);
```
::: warning Answer
This question quizzes the coder on how the PHP interpreter handles numbers and strings.
i. var_dump(42 == 042); will output bool(false) because the PHP interpreter treats leading zeroes as octals. 042 is 32 in decimal, which does not equal 42.
ii. var_dump(‘042’ == 42); will output bool(true) because PHP interpreter will coerce the string into an integer but ignore the leading zero. 42 is equal to 42.
iii. var_dump(‘042’ === 42); will output bool(false) because the === operator performs a stricter comparison and will not coerce the integer into a string.

### Explain why the two code snippets below will evaluate to the same output.
```php
$x = true or false;
var_dump($x);

$x = true and false;
var_dump($x);
```
::: warning Answer
This question is designed to test a coder’s knowledge of the order of operations. The first block of code is more straightforward, evaluating to true because of the “or” operator. The second code block, however, would typically be expected to evaluate to false. Instead, it evaluates to true because of how the PHP interpreter handles the order of operations: “=” is prioritized leading to the following equivalent code snippet:

$x = true; // sets $x equal to true
True and false; // evaluates to false, but does not affect anything
:::

### If $x = 100 + “25%” + “$40” what is the value of $x and why?
::: warning Answer
The answer is $x = 125, because PHP uses automatic type conversion in deciding how to treat variables and values depending on how they are used. When PHP encounters a string during an arithmetic operation, it will interpret any numerical value and ignore the remainder in order from left to right. Strings that don’t start with numbers are evaluated to zero.

$x = 100 + 25 + 0 = 125.
:::

### Predict the output of the code below. Explain your answer.
```php
$x = 2
$y = 4
$z = 6


if($z > $y > $x) {
    echo “true”;
}else{
    echo “false”;
}
```
::: warning Answer
At first glance, one would expect the boolean to evaluate to “true” because 6 > 4 > 2. However, the correct answer is “false” because PHP will first evaluate $z > $y, which returns a boolean value of 1 or true. It is this boolean value of 1 that is compared to the next integer in the chain, bool(1) > $z, which will result in NULL and echo “false.”

### What will be the output of this script?
```php
$a = '1';
$b = &$a;
$b = "2$b";
echo $a.", ".$b;
```
::: warning Answer
21, 21

## IP address
How do you proceed if you need to get a user’s IP address?”
::: warning Answer
This question shows the level of creativity of the developer, as there are many possibilities to find an IP address.  For example, we can use the script : $_SERVER[“REMOTE_ADDR”];
This is the fastest and most obvious answer, but a multitude of other solutions are possible.
:::

## Traits
### What are Traits made for?
::: warning Answer
Traits are an advanced feature of PHP, they allow to create reusable code in a language like PHP. A Trait cannot be generated by itself, the candidate must be familiar with the advanced functionalities of a programming language in which he or she will be required to work. Knowledge of these features is an important indication of the candidate’s familiarity with this language.
:::

## Errors
### Describe the three error types that exist in PHP.
::: warning Answer
Knowledge of error types is fundamental for any developer, especially those who use PHP. This knowledge allows the developer to understand where the errors come from in order to be able to fix them as well as possible.

Here the candidate must first list the error types and then explain them. He must say that there are three errors types: Notices, Warning and Fatal. Then, the candidate must explain that Notices are errors that occur when the error is simple and non-critical, while Warning is a more serious error. In both cases, these errors will not cause the script to stop running. The last error, called Fatal, is much more problematic since it causes the script to stop running.
:::

## Good programmer
What do you think are the essential attributes that a PHP developer should have?

::: warning Answer
This job interview question is a classic one, but some answers are expected from a good PHP programmer.

These include logical reasoning, analytical thinking, perseverance, insatiable curiosity, rigor and abnegation.

Each of these qualities is evidence of the candidate’s ability to work as a PHP developer.
:::

## Classes
### What is the role of _construct() and _destruct() methods in a PHP class?
The answer to this interview question determines whether the candidate has any knowledge of object-oriented programming. All objects in the PHP language have construct and destruct methods built-in. The Constructor method is used each time a new class instance is created, it is then called to initialize the properties of this class. The destruct method does not accept any parameters.

## Constants
### Can the value that was previously assigned to a constant change during script execution?

::: warning Answer
No. When a value has been assigned to a constant, it cannot change during the script execution.
:::

## Functions
### What is the difference between unset() and unlink()?

::: warning Answer
Using unset() allows the developer to change the variable to an undefined state, while the unlink() command deletes the file that is sent from the system.
:::

### Declare a function, which will only accept the word “Hello” as a parameter.

If the data entered matches what was requested, then the function will display “Hello”. Otherwise it will display “Bye”.
```php
function showMessage($hello = false) {
  echo ($hello) ? 'hello' : 'bye';
}
```
::: warning Answer
This question is a very good opportunity to assess the candidate’s ability to declare functions.
:::

## Arrays
### How to proceed in order to get the quantity of elements in an array?
::: warning Answer
Here, we are dealing with a rather basic interview question about arrays. Knowing how to extract data from an array is part of the basic knowledge for any properly trained junior developer.
If you’re not familiar with the term “array”, here’s a definition :

An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements. Typically these elements are all of the same data type, such as an integer or string. Arrays are commonly used in computer programs to organize data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.
For example, a search engine may use an array to store Web pages found in a search performed by the user. When displaying the results, the program will output one element of the array at a time. This may be done for a specified number of values or until all the values stored in the array have been output. While the program could create a new variable for each result found, storing the results in an array is much more efficient way to manage memory.

The optimal answer here is to use the count () function.
:::

## Frameworks
### Could you name some PHP frameworks?
::: warning Answer
During the interview, the interviewed candidate must mention at least three PHP frameworks among this list:

- Laravel, a free, open-source, PHP web framework intended for the development of web applications following the MVC architectural pattern and based on Symfony. It’s the most popular PHP framework.
- CodeIgniter, an open-source software rapid development web framework, used to build dynamic sites with PHP.
- Symfony, a PHP web application framework and a set of reusable components and libraries. It is released under the MIT license.
- CakePHP
- FuelPHP
- PHPixie
- Phalcon
- Slim
- Zend Framework
- Yii 2
:::

## Getters and Setters
Why use Getters and Setters?
::: warning Answer
Getters and Setters are methods used to declare or get the value of a private variable. They allow data to be processed, reported and displayed. Within these methods, it is possible to process the data, which will then be assigned within a variable function.
:::

## Functions
### What is the difference between the functions include() and require()?
::: warning Answer
The first one, contrary to the second one, is used to ensure that a file is included within the script during its execution. The candidate can use a demonstration, in which we have for example five files, one.txt, two.txt and so on up to five. The files contain numbers from one to five (a number in each file).
```php
for($i=1; $i<=5; $i++) {
  include "$i.txt";
}
```

The compilation time has been included once in each file. On the other hand, if we make the decision to write require instead of the other command, we will get a fatal error.
Another difference between these two commands is that require always gives a fatal error if the requested file is missing, while include will simply display a warning, and continue to compile the code.
:::

## Functions
### The value of the input variable is 9,3,5,5,7,8. How do I get the sum of the numbers of this list?
::: warning Answer
```php
$input = '9,3,5,5,7,8';
echo array_sum(explode(',', $input));
```
The explode function is one of the most frequently used in PHP language, so it is very important to understand if the candidate masters this function.
:::

### What is the correct way to create a function in PHP?
::: warning Answer
The answer to this very easy interview question is:
```php
function functionName() {
  // Function code.
}
```
A candidate who is unable to answer it does not have sufficient PHP skills
:::

### What is the mail() function used for?
::: warning Answer
The answer to this question is that this function can be used to send an email from a PHP script.
:::

## Scope
### How many scope levels exist in the PHP language? Describe them.
::: warning Answer
This interview question shows that the future PHP developer understands the essence of programming and is not just typing code without thinking beforehand. Moreover, this issue is important from the standpoint of data security, which is a key issue in our time.

The candidate must mention here the three existing scope levels of PHP which are Private, Public and Protected, and explain that the first level is visible only in his own class, the second one is visible by any script performing accessing the class and the last one is visible only by the parent classes.
:::

## Operators
### Why should you use === and not ==?
::: warning Answer
=== and == are two PHP comparison operators.

First of all === is faster than ==, because it does not convert the different types. In addition, if you want to check a particular type === will do exactly what you requested, while == will convert the data only for a limited time and will try to use both types of operators.
:::

### How to combine two strings in PHP?
::: warning Answer
To concatenate two string variables, just use the dot(.) operator

This results in a single string.
:::

## MySQL
### How to connect a MySQL database using PHP?
::: warning Answer
MySQL is the most popular database system used with PHP. The answer to this interview question is to use mysql_connection function.

### What are PHP sessions and how do they work?
::: warning TIP
What you’re really asking is whether they know how to use session_start(). It either creates or resumes a session based on an identifier that is sent to the server via a GET or POST request or a cookie. The most common use case scenario on the web is when a website won’t let you comment or post without first prompting a login. How does it know whether you’re logged in? One way would be to place a cookie in the user’s browser; on every request the cookie is sent server-side, where PHP can be used to determine which information is sent back and displayed to the client. While session_start() saves session data in files by default, it is also possible to store sessions directly in the database.
:::
::: warning Answer
When you work with an application, you open it, do some changes, and then you close it. This is much like a Session. The computer knows who you are. It knows when you start the application and when you end. But on the internet there is one problem: the web server does not know who you are or what you do, because the HTTP address doesn't maintain state.

Session variables solve this problem by storing user information to be used across multiple pages (e.g. username, favorite color, etc). By default, session variables last until the user closes the browser.

So; Session variables hold information about one single user, and are available to all pages in one application.

If you need a permanent storage, you may want to store the data in a database.
:::


### Useful functions for session control?
::: warning Answer
```php
// Start the session
session_start();
// remove all session variables
session_unset();
// destroy the session
session_destroy();
// Set session variables
$_SESSION["favcolor"] = "green";
```

### How are classes loaded in PHP?
::: tip Read More
- [www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php)
:::
::: warning Answer
This is a good way to gauge a developer’s understanding of autoloading. Whenever a class is instantiated, a function is triggered. You can register a function with the spl_autoload que detailed below.
```php
bool spl_autoload_register ([ callable $autoload_function [, bool$throw = true [, bool $prepend = false ]]] )
```

## Responsive
Consider a responsive site design that requires a full-width image in all responsive states. What would be the correct way to code this to ensure the page loads the smallest image required to fill the space?
### Answer
The key attributes here are `srcset` and `sizes`. These attributes allow the developer to specify multiple image sizes for on `<img>`, for example:
```html
<img src="https://example.com/images/image.png" srcset="https://example.com/images/image-1024.png 1024w, https://example.com/images/image-512.png 512w" sizes="100vw">
```
By using srcset and sizes, the browser will then intelligently select the correct image source to be used based on the size of the visitorâ€™s viewport.

Any suggestions of changing the image source using JavaScript based on the size of the viewport should be seen as a red flag. This indicates the developer has not been keeping current with CSS feature support and/or best practices.

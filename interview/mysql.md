## Queries
### Consider the following database table design:
```sql
CREATE TABLE `notifications` (
	`id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	`type` INT(8) NOT NULL,
	`notifiable_id` INT unsigned NOT NULL,
	`notifiable_type` VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
	`relation_id_1` INT unsigned,
	`relation_type_1` VARCHAR(10),
	`relation_id_2` INT unsigned,
	`relation_type_2` VARCHAR(10),
	`updated_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	`created_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);
```
What is wrong with the above and how could it be improved?
::: warning Answer
The key issue with the proposed table design are the object_id_X and object_type_X fields. It is considered poor design to increment named fields when the data could be stored in a related table like so:

Notifications Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE `notifications` (
	`id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	`type` INT(8) NOT NULL,
	`notifiable_id` INT unsigned NOT NULL,
	`notifiable_type` VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
	`updated_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	`created_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);
```
Notification Relations Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE `notification_relations` (
	`notification_id` INT unsigned NOT NULL,
	`relation_id` INT unsigned NOT NULL,
	`relation_type` VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (`notification_id`)
);
```
:::

### Consider the following two tables:
```sql
CREATE TABLE `posts` (
	`id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	`text` TEXT,
	`user_id` INT unsigned NOT NULL,
	`updated_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	`created_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);

CREATE TABLE `post_likes` (
	`post_id` INT unsigned NOT NULL,
	`user_id` INT unsigned NOT NULL,
	`created_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```
Write a query to retrieve all data from the posts table for a given user_id. In addition to this, the returned recordset should also include a count of post_likes for each post.
::: warning Answer
Firstly, and most importantly, the answer should include one, and only one, query. There are numerous ways to achieve the expected result, but the correct way is the following:
```sql
SELECT
   posts.*,
   COUNT(post_likes.user_id) AS likes 
FROM
   posts 
   LEFT JOIN
      post_likes 
      ON posts.id = post_likes.post_id
WHERE posts.user_id = 'XXX'
GROUP BY posts.id
```

- Only comparison operators can be used =, <,>, = >,=<
- AUTO_INCREMENT is not supported by HEAP tables

:::

### Differentiate between FLOAT and DOUBLE? 
::: warning Answer
Following are differences for FLOAT and DOUBLE:
- Floating point numbers are stored in FLOAT with eight place accuracy and it has four bytes.
- Floating point numbers are stored in DOUBLE with accuracy of 18 places and it has eight bytes.
:::

### Differentiate CHAR_LENGTH and LENGTH?

CHAR_LENGTH  is character count whereas the LENGTH is byte count. The numbers are same for Latin characters but they are different for Unicode and other encodings.
:::

### How to represent ENUMs and SETs internally? 
::: warning Answer
ENUMs and SETs are used to represent powers of two because of storage optimizations.
:::

### What is the usage of ENUMs in MySQL?
::: warning Answer
ENUM is a string object used to specify set of predefined values and that can be used during table creation.
```sql
Create table size(name ENUM('Small', 'Medium','Large');
```
:::

### Define REGEXP? 
::: warning Answer
REGEXP is a pattern match in which  matches pattern anywhere in the search value.
:::

### Difference between CHAR and VARCHAR? 
::: warning Answer
Following are the differences between CHAR and VARCHAR:

- CHAR and VARCHAR types differ in storage and retrieval
- CHAR column length is fixed to the length that is declared while creating table. The length value ranges from 1 and 255
- When CHAR values are stored then they are right padded using spaces to specific length. Trailing spaces are removed when CHAR values are retrieved.

is used to get the current version of MySQL.
:::

### What storage engines are used in MySQL?
::: warning Answer
Storage engines are called table types and data is stored in files using various techniques.

Technique involves:

- Storage mechanism
- Locking levels
- Indexing
- Capabilities and functions.

:::

### What does a TIMESTAMP do on UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP data type?
::: warning Answer
TIMESTAMP column is updated with Zero when the table is created.  UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP modifier updates the timestamp field to  current time whenever there is a change in other fields of the table.
:::

### What is the difference between primary key and candidate key?
::: warning Answer
Every row of a table is identified uniquely by primary key. There is only one primary key for a table.

Primary Key is also a candidate key. By common convention, candidate key can be designated as primary and which can be used for any foreign key references.
:::

### How do you login to MySql using Unix shell?

:::

### What happens when the column is set to AUTO INCREMENT and if you reach maximum value in the table?
::: warning Answer
It stops incrementing. Any further inserts are going to produce an error, since the key has been used already.

:::

### What is the difference between BLOB AND TEXT?
::: warning Answer
A BLOB is a binary large object that can hold a variable amount of data. There are four types of BLOB â€“

- TINYBLOB
- BLOB
- MEDIUMBLOB and
- LONGBLOB
They all differ only in the maximum length of the values they can hold.

A TEXT is a case-insensitive BLOB. The four TEXT types

- TINYTEXT
- TEXT
- MEDIUMTEXT and
- LONGTEXT
They all correspond to the four BLOB types and have the same maximum lengths and storage requirements.

The only difference between BLOB and TEXT types is that sorting and comparison is performed in case-sensitive for BLOB values and case-insensitive for TEXT values.

## Pair programming
What do you think of the pair programming?
### Answer
Pair programming is a new working method that consists of having two developers work together on the same workstation.

This way of working has not been adopted by all companies, and perhaps not by yours. However, thanks to this question, you will know if the PHP developer you are questioning is a team player.

## Industry
What do you know about our industry?
### Answer
This question is very important, and some candidates will be unable to answer it. A PHP developer who knows, even vaguely, the industry in which you’re doing business, shows a certain curiosity and that he is able to take a step back.

## Culture
What type of corporate culture do you prefer?
### Answer
Depending on whether your company has an entrepreneurial or managerial corporate culture, its operating mode is not the same. You should favor candidates who prefer the type of corporate culture in place in your organization.

However, it is preferable for the candidate to provide a nuanced answer. Indeed, a candidate who totally rejects a structured corporate culture may suggest that he or she will have difficulty following the guidelines. On the other hand, a candidate who answers that he/she hates entrepreneurial corporate culture may not be able to think outside the box, and to work independently. Don’t forget that soft skills are part of the skills a good PHP programmer should have.

## Experience with the user
Do you have experience working in a client-facing role, or working directly with the user? If not, would you like to?
### Answer
This question is another way of asking how well your candidate is able to deal with criticism. Whether feedback originates from within the company or is generated by the users, inevitably all projects will be the subject of strong words. The ability to treat critique as an opportunity to improve is an important personality trait, yet may not be well honed in each of your candidates.

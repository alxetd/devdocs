Consider a site design that simply has a login form in the center of the page. Using CSS, what is the best way to ensure the box is horizontally and vertically centered?

There are technically various ways to achieve this. However, nowadays, there is one “correct” way to do this: using display: flex and margin: auto.

Other methods include position: absolute;, top: 50%, and margin-top: -Xpx, but these are no longer considered good practices since the introduction of display: flex.

The candidateâ€™s knowledge of server side database tools will be tested with each and every project. With the rise in popularity of NoSQL, it is important to understand how and when it is properly used in place of a relational model. This general knowledge question will provide insight as to how the candidate keeps up to date with new technologies.
##  Server-side programming and design patterns
